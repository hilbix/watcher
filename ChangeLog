	* watcher.py (WatchFile.read): EOF detection (socket close).  EOF
	is signalled by empty string of recv, not with an exception (why
	not?).  This case is now detected, too.

	* watcher.py: more pythonic
	(Watcher.layoutImp): fixed division by 0 in case of 0 files
	(Watcher.scroll): now scrolling is only enabled if scrolling, so
	jump mode works.
	(Watcher.layoutImp): hint if there are no files to watch
	(move_terminal_to_fd, WatchPipe.__init__): refuse stdin if
	problematic, this fixes multiple - values as well

	* watcher.py (Watcher.setColor): Now can be used to change the colors
	(Watcher.run): Keystrokes for color changing
	(Watcher.run): status message
	(Watcher.charcode): keystrokes are presented
	(Watcher.run): clock etc.
	(Watcher.layoutImp): improved layout (use complete screen)
