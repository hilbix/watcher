This is a tool to watch many files or unix domain sockets for updates.
You can watch stdin, too.  It is missing some layout and control features yet.

It has special support for the BEL character (^G or \07) to make it more visible.

If you find some bug or think you need an interesting feature
(interesting for me, not for you) leave me a message at
URL https://hydra.geht.net/pager.php

If you want to send patches, please be sure to waive your Copyright on
the changes first, else they are incompatible to the CLL.
You can push the patches to GitHub and send me a pull request there.
