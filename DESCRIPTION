A Python2.6 script to watch files, pipes or Unix domain sockets

If you have a couple of files to watch in parallel and when
`tail --follow=file -f files...' get's a bit confusing,
just try ./watcher.py files... 

It's not perfect, but it is able to read from files, pipes and
Unix domain sockets.  If a BEL character (^G, ASCII 7) is received,
the line is marked red.

Not yet implemented is to allow keystrokes to be send to the
unix domain sockets as well, like a poor man's terminal.
